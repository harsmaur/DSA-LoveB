//  Padding and greedy alignment are typically discussed in the context of data structures and memory layout rather than C++ objects specifically. However, C++ objects can be influenced by these concepts due to the way the language handles memory alignment.

// Here's a brief explanation of padding and alignment:

// Padding:

// Padding is used to align data structures in memory to improve access speed.
// It involves adding unused bytes between the members of a structure to ensure that each member starts at an address that is a multiple of its size or the system's alignment requirement.
// Padding is added by the compiler to meet alignment constraints, which can depend on the hardware architecture.
// Alignment:

// Alignment refers to the requirement that certain types must be stored at addresses that are multiples of their size.
// For example, on many systems, a 4-byte integer should be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.
// The alignof operator in C++ can be used to query the alignment requirement of a type.


class MyClass {
private:
    const int constantValue;

public:
    MyClass(int value) : constantValue(value) {
        // Initialization list is used to initialize const member variable
    }
};
